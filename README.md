# WORMS: A Personal Project Based on Image Manipulation

Welcome to an abandoned project that I had worked on in my
junior year of college. This is an image manipulation software,
intended to apply delaunay triangulation to pictures of
flatworms to straighten out the images and allow for analysis of
those images. While I don't intend to continue working on this immediately, I may decide to return to it in the future

-- MORE TO COME --
